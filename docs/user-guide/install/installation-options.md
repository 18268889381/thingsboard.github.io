Thingsboard is designed to run and utilize on majority of hardware, from local Raspberry PI to powerful servers in the cloud.

Ways to set up a Thingsboard cluster include:


 - [Docker (Linux or Mac OS)](/docs/user-guide/install/docker/) - install a single-node Thingsboard cluster on your Linux or Mac OS machine for development and testing.
 - [Docker (Windows)](/docs/user-guide/install/docker-windows/) - install a single-node Thingsboard cluster on your Windows machine for development and testing.
 - [Linux](/docs/user-guide/install/linux/) - install a Thingboard cluster on any pre-existing machines running Linux.
