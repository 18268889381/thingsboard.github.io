## Default dashboard for customer user

Since Thingsboard 1.2 you are now able to define default dashboard for your customer users in 2 simple steps:

#### Step 1. Assign dashboard to customer

See embedded video tutorial above on tips how to do this.

#### Step 2. Open customer user details

Navigate to "**Customers** -> Your customer -> **Customer Users**" and toggle edit mode using 'pencil' button in the top-right corner of the screen.

#### Step 3. Select dashboard 

select the dashboard from the list and apply changes. Please note that you can also check the "Always Fullscreen" mode 
to prevent user from navigating to different dashboards/screens.
