[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino/) is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. 
You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. 
It is like the brain of a project.

The applications in this samples that are running on Arduino are developed using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
