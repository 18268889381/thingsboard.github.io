        We were struggling trying to implement our own IOT infrastructure when ThingsBoard suddenly appeared. Immediately we started testing and were amazed with the feature completeness, stability and ease of use of this great platform, although it was only in version 1.0 and had been released just days prior.

        Our business needed some special features on the frontend and some major modifications on the backend but after exchanging a few emails it was clear that ThingsBoard was the way to go. The necessary changes were implemented in a matter of a few weeks and the quality and thoroughness of the implementation far exceed our expectations. I've been working with OSS since the mid 1990s and know of it's many benefits but the quality of ThingsBoard as well as the speed of development continues to impress me.
