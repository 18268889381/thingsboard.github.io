        X-TELIA is a Canadian LoRaWAN™ network operator and IoT integrator 
        </h4>
        <p>
        We were looking for a robust and scalable IoT platform to help us deploy leading edge LoRaWAN™-based IoT projects.
        </p> 
        <p>
        We landed a contract to deploy a city-wide network of solar/wireless variable message “No Parking” signs to manage on-street parking for snow removal operations.  The deadline to develop, test and deploy the overall solution was very tight and included penalties for late delivery.
        </p> 
        <p>
        ThingsBoard engineers worked hand in hand with our developers to develop the MQTT-based communication protocol between the X-TELIA network and ThingsBoard, developed a beautiful custom widget for controlling the no parking signs, implemented our instance of ThingsBoard PE and provided incredible support to make sure we made it to the finish line on time.
        </p> 
        <p>
        I can say that the dedication of ThingsBoard team blew me away. I look forward to building and deploying many new and exciting projects on ThingsBoard, as I know the team backing the platform is second to none in expertise and dedication.
