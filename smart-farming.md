## Overview

Thingsboard platform provides out-of-the-box components and APIs to dramatically reduce time to market and amount of efforts for development of smart farming solutions and projects.
The platform itself is device agnostic, so you can feed data from any sensor or application.
Save up to 90% of development time for your smart farming project by utilizing following benefits:
 
 - Reliable and fault tolerant data collection from your IoT devices and sensors to monitor facilities state, crop growth characteristics, etc.
 - Advanced and flexible data visualization for real-time and historical monitoring of future farms.
 - Customizable end-user dashboards to share farm monitoring results.
 - Integration with third-party analytics frameworks and solutions for advanced analytics and machine learning.
 - Optimize returns on inputs while preserving resources by remotely configuring IoT Devices based on results of the analytics.

The platform provides production ready server infrastructure to connect your IoT devices, store and analyze collected IoT data, optimizing returns on inputs and resources.
