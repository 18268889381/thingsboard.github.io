## Frequently asked questions

### Trial & Billing

#### What does "free trial" mean?

AWS marketplace will not charge you for the TB PE License during the trial, however, you will still need to pay for the AWS EC2 infrastructure you use (server instance, disk, network and optional services).  

#### What does "hourly charges" mean?

AWS is going to charge you for each hour the server is running. Most of the servers are running 24/7, because they need to be able to constantly serve requests from devices or users. 
However, if you are using this server for a development purposes can stop the server to save time in the end of the work day.

#### What is the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for my TB PE instance? 

The typical total cost of ownership consists of:

* TB License fee - see pricing above
* AWS EC2 instance price - we believe [ec2instances.info](https://www.ec2instances.info/) is a convenient resource to compare prices.
* Additional EC2 costs for network traffic, disk space and other optional services (Cloud Watch or similar)

Example A: The price for TB PE Maker instance based on t2.micro with 20 GB disk will cost approximately $20.5 per month:
 
* $10.08 for 720 hours of TB PE Maker license fee  
* $8.468 for 1 month of t2.micro usage
* $2.0 for 20 GB of EBS volume per month

Example B: The price for TB PE Prototype instance based on t2.medium with 100 GB disk will cost approximately $143.862 per month:

* $99.99 for 720 hours of TB PE Maker license fee  
* $33.872 for 1 month of t2.medium usage
* $10.0 for 100 GB of EBS volume per month      

All prices are in USD.
